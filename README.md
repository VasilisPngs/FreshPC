**FreshPC:** This is a Windows batch script that automates the cleanup of temporary files and the clearing of memory-related components in order to optimize system performance. The script removes temporary files and folders from user profiles, as well as .dmp and .old files from those same locations. It then clears various memory-related components, including the standby list, combined page list, modified page list, working set of all processes, and system working set. The script can be useful for users who want to optimize their system's performance by freeing up memory and removing unnecessary files.



**UpdateSoftwares:** This is a Windows batch script designed to automate the process of checking for and installing updates using the Winget and Chocolatey package managers. It checks if the necessary package managers are installed, checks for updates, and upgrades packages automatically. It is intended to save time and effort for users who regularly manage packages on Windows.

**NOTE: If winget and chocolatey are not installed on your computer after you first run the tool and it installs them, once it closes, run the tool again and it will work fine.**
