Run this CMD commands scripts and see the magic. Cheers.


NOTE: Open them as administrator.


CleanPC: This batch script clears various caches and logs on a Windows computer, including Windows error reports, Event Log, temporary files, LiveId logs, prefetch files, update cache, DNS cache, system error memory dump and minidump files, and MUI cache. It also renews the IP address.


UpdateSoftwares: This script checks for updates of installed applications on Windows using two package managers: Winget and Chocolatey. It counts available updates by reading two output files, and updates all packages using the corresponding package manager command. The script deletes the temporary output files and exits after 5 seconds.


FreeRam: This script is designed to free up memory on a Windows system by clearing the standby cache reserve and working set of all processes. The script concludes with a success message once memory has been released. It can be used to resolve performance issues caused by low memory.



Yes, my friend, it is free of viruses. Check it out without fear.
